This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Notes on Next js

First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

next.config.js files --> Is a development mode only feature for highlighting potential problems in an application,
                                  --> It helps to identify and save life-cycles
```
